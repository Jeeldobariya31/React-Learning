# React Hooks Demo

This project provides a simple demonstration of several fundamental React hooks.

## Components

### `UseStateDemo`

A basic counter that demonstrates the use of the `useState` hook to manage state in a functional component.

### `UseEffectDemo`

This component shows how to use the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects in a functional component. It logs messages to the screen when the component mounts, unmounts, and when the component's state changes.

### `UseRefDemo`

This component demonstrates two common use cases for the `useRef` hook:

1.  Accessing DOM elements directly.
2.  Creating a mutable variable that does not cause a re-render when it changes.

### `UseReducer`

A counter implemented with the `useReducer` hook, which is an alternative to `useState` for managing more complex state logic.

## How to Run

1.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
2.  Start the development server: `npm run dev`
    
    This command will start a local development server and open the application in your default web browser.
